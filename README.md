# 🤖 Face Recognition Attendance System

## 🌟 Overview
An intelligent attendance tracking solution using cutting-edge face recognition technology. Capture, verify, and log attendance seamlessly with a simple Python script.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔍 Advanced Face Recognition
- Utilizes DeepFace for accurate face verification
- Supports multiple known faces
- Instant identification and attendance marking

### 🕒 Automated Attendance Tracking
- Real-time webcam image capture
- Automatic timestamp logging
- Excel spreadsheet integration

### 🚀 Easy Expandability
- Simple face database management
- Add new faces by placing images in the `faces/` folder

## 🛠 Prerequisites

### 💻 System Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Webcam
- Stable internet connection

### 📦 Dependencies
- OpenCV
- Pandas
- DeepFace
- Openpyxl

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Suneel-DK/face_recognition_attendance.git
cd face_recognition_attendance
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Prepare Known Faces
- Place individual face images in the `images/` folder
- Name files as `firstname.jpg` (e.g., `virat.jpg`, `john.png`)

### 4. Run the Attendance System
```bash
python main.py
```

## 📂 Project Structure
```

│
├── images/             # Known faces directory
│   ├── virat.jpg
│   └── john.png

├── main.py             # Main recognition script
├── attendance.xlsx     # Auto-generated attendance log
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## 🔧 How It Works
1. Opens webcam and captures live image
2. Compares image against stored face database
3. Identifies and verifies individuals
4. Logs attendance with precise timestamp
5. Automatically stops after face recognition

## 💡 Pro Tips
- Use well-lit, clear face images for best results
- Ensure consistent image backgrounds
- Maintain a front-facing pose in reference images

## 🚧 Upcoming Features
- [ ] Multi-face detection support
- [ ] Database integration
- [ ] Advanced logging mechanisms
- [ ] Machine learning-enhanced recognition

## 🛡️ Troubleshooting
- **ModuleNotFoundError**: Verify all dependencies are installed
- **Poor Recognition**: Improve image quality and lighting
- **Webcam Issues**: Check camera permissions and connections
